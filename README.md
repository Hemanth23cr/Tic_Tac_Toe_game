# Tic_Tac_Toe_game

Tic Tac Toe Game coded in python

I created this program for practice with coding in the Python language, which I had only recently learned when I created this game. Standard rules apply. 1st player uses the O symbol, second player which is computer uses the X symbol.


This is a simple one-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe that I made in Python. It is one of my first coding projects. To play, enter a row and column number (from 0 to 9) to select a space.
